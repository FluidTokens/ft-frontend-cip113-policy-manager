# CIP-113 Policy Manager - Quick Guide

## Introduction

CIP-113 is a Cardano Improvement Proposal that defines smart tokens with programmable transfer rules. This application allows you to create, mint, and manage CIP-113 compliant tokens with built-in access control mechanisms.

### Prerequisites

- **Wallet Connection**: Connect a Cardano wallet (Nami, Eternl, etc.)
- **Admin Rights**: You must be an admin to mint tokens for a policy
- **Network**: Currently running on Cardano Preview Testnet

---

## 1. Create Policy

Create a new CIP-113 policy that defines the rules and governance for your token.

### Form Fields

- **Token Name\*** (required): Name of your token (max 32 characters)
- **Admin Addresses**: Comma-separated list of additional admin addresses. Your wallet address is automatically included as admin
- **Enable Blacklist**: Restrict specific addresses from receiving/sending tokens
- **Enable Whitelist**: Allow only specific addresses to receive/send tokens

### Smart Contract Details

The policy creation deploys two Plutus V3 smart contracts:

1. **Rule Script** (Withdraw Validator): Enforces blacklist/whitelist rules and validates admin signatures
   - Parameterized with: blacklist linked list, whitelist linked list, admin public key hashes

2. **Smart Token Script** (Minting Policy): Controls token minting and transfer logic
   - Parameterized with: token name (hex), rule script policy hash

### Transaction Flow

1. User submits form with token configuration
2. System generates both validator scripts with parameters
3. Two stake credentials are registered on-chain (one for each script)
4. Transaction is signed by user's wallet and submitted
5. Policy ID is generated from the minting script hash

**Example Transaction:**

```

## 2. Mint Tokens

Mint tokens under an existing policy. Only admin addresses can mint tokens.

### Form Fields

- **Selected Policy\*** (required): Choose from policies where you are an admin
- **Quantity\*** (required): Amount of tokens to mint (must be > 0)

### Smart Contract Details

The minting transaction interacts with both validators:

- **Minting Script**: Validates the minting redeemer and checks rule script validation
- **Rule Script**: Executed via withdrawal (0 ADA) to verify admin signature and enforce rules

Tokens are sent to a **smart receiver address** - a script address parameterized with the user's public key hash. This ensures CIP-113 compliance and enables programmable transfer logic.

### Transaction Flow

1. User selects a policy and specifies quantity
2. System calculates smart receiver address for current user
3. Transaction builds:
   - Minting output with specified quantity
   - Required signer: user's public key hash
   - Withdrawal from rule script (0 ADA) to trigger validation
   - Output sent to user's smart receiver address
4. Transaction is signed and submitted
5. Tokens appear in user's CIP-113 token balance

**Example Transaction:**

```
Transaction URL: https://preview.cexplorer.io/tx/3dccad56b252499e4b9d0809f9d453cb13ffcd11dc6760d81fe0616e39ef7365?tab=overview
```

## 3. Transfer Tokens

Transfer CIP-113 tokens to another Cardano address.

### Form Fields

- **Recipient Address\*** (required): Destination Cardano address (addr1...)
- **Amount\*** (required): Quantity to transfer (must be â‰¤ available balance)

The modal automatically displays:

- Current token balance
- Token name and policy information
- Transfer summary with sender/recipient details

### Smart Contract Details

CIP-113 transfers involve spending from script addresses:

- **Smart Token Script**: Validates transfer redeemer and rule compliance
- **Rule Script**: Verifies sender signature and checks blacklist/whitelist rules

Both the sender and recipient use **smart receiver addresses** parameterized with their respective public key hashes.

### Transaction Flow

1. User specifies recipient address and amount
2. System selects appropriate UTxO containing tokens
3. System calculates:
   - Recipient's smart receiver address
   - Change amount (if not transferring full balance)
4. Transaction builds:
   - Spending input: UTxO from sender's smart receiver address
   - Output 1: Tokens to recipient's smart receiver address
   - Output 2 (if change): Remaining tokens back to sender's smart receiver address
   - Withdrawals from both smart token and rule scripts (0 ADA each)
   - Required signer: sender's public key hash
5. Transaction is signed and submitted
6. Tokens are transferred to recipient's CIP-113 address

**Example Transaction:**

```
Transaction URL: https://preview.cexplorer.io/tx/418731ff5e281ce158991cd47cf607bbf35ce15d92962a4750ac43d91f6b13b2?tab=overview
```

## Technical Notes

- **Script Addresses**: All CIP-113 tokens are held in script addresses (smart receiver addresses), not regular wallet addresses
- **Collateral**: Transactions involving smart contracts require collateral UTxOs
- **Plutus Version**: All scripts are Plutus V3
- **Redeemers**: Minting uses `ConStr0`, transfers use `ConStr0` for token script and `ConStr1` for rule validation
